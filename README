This is a simple C++ program that contains five different functionalities based on user input. The program prompts the user to select an option from the menu of available functions and then performs the corresponding action.

Functions:

Odd or Even - The user is prompted to enter a number and then asked to choose whether to display all odd or even numbers up to the input value.

Leap year or non-Leap year - The user is prompted to enter two years and the program displays all leap years between those years.

Greater of 3 numbers - The user is prompted to enter three numbers and the program determines and displays the greatest of those numbers.

Prime number - The user is prompted to enter two numbers and the program displays all prime numbers between those numbers.

Factorial - This function is not implemented in the current version of the program.

To run the program, compile and execute the source code file. The program will prompt the user for input, and then display the output based on the selected function.

Note: The program only accepts integer inputs for all options. Additionally, some functions have limitations, such as displaying only odd or even numbers and displaying leap years only between two years. The program may not work as expected for other input values outside of its limitations.
